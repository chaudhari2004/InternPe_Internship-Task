## Introduction

This repository is part of my internship tasks, showcasing three different Java-based games. Each game is implemented with a focus on clean code, good practices, and user-friendly interfaces.

## Games

### Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where the objective is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does.

#### Features
- Two-player mode
- Simple text-based interface
- Input validation

### Random Number Guessing

In the Random Number Guessing game, the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

#### Features
- Configurable range for the random number
- Feedback on each guess
- Keeps track of the number of attempts

### Connect Four

Connect Four is a two-player connection game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The goal is to connect four of one's own discs in a row, column, or diagonal.

#### Features
- Two-player mode
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Highlighting the winning sequence

## Setup and Usage
